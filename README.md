Homework 07 ‚Äì Comic Store Extravaganza!
Authors: Xavier, Nimrath
Topics: recursion, merge sort
Problem Description
Due to the stagnant nature of the recent MCU films, the CS1331 TA team have decided to return to the
original source and delve into the world of comics! Unfortunately, as the TAs are all Georgia Tech
students, they have no time to browse the unorganized bins filled with thousands of stories. In this
assignment, you will give the CS1331 TAs some reprise and organize the comic book bins for them using
some recursive methods!
Solution Description
You will need to complete and turn in 1 class: ComicBookBin.java.
Notes:
1. All methods should be accessible from everywhere and must not require an instance to be
accessed through, unless specified otherwise.
2. You will be able to use provided methods from RecursionUtils.java, Superhero.java, and
Alliance.java. Review the Javadocs for these classes and be careful not to modify these files.
3. Reuse code when possible and helper methods with appropriate visibility are optional.
4. Make sure to add Javadoc comments to your methods and classes!
5. All methods in this assignment must use recursion or call recursive helper methods.
ComicBookBin.java
This class will hold all the recursive methods you will be implementing.
Methods:
‚Ä¢ mergeSortHeroes
o Takes in a Superhero[] and returns a Superhero[] containing the same elements
as the input array sorted in ascending lexicographical order by name.
¬ß Assume the input array will not be null nor contain null elements.
o The implementation to sort the input array must be recursive merge sort.
o This method should have a time complexity of ùëÇ(ùëõ log ùëõ).
o No loops are permitted to be written in this method nor in a helper method you create.
¬ß Hint: Use the copyOfRange method in RecursionUtils.java to create
subarrays.
o When merging two arrays, you must use the merge method from RecursionUtils.java.
o Example (each ‚Äú{name}‚Äù represents a SuperHero object; the alliance is omitted):
¬ß Input: ["Spider-Man", "Iron Man", "Captain America",
"Thor", "Hulk"]
¬ß Output:["Captain America", "Hulk", "Iron Man",
"Spider-Man", "Thor"]

‚Ä¢ mergeHeroes
o Takes in a Superhero[][] of teams, where you may assume each team contains
superheroes sorted in ascending lexicographical order by name.
¬ß Note: A sub-team is represented by a Superhero[].
¬ß Assume the input array will not be null nor contain null elements, and that the
array at each index will also not contain null elements.
o Returns a Superhero[] containing all the heroes from each sub-team, sorted in
ascending lexicographical order by name.
o If the input array contains no sub-teams, or if all sub-teams are empty, return an empty
array of length 0.
o When merging two arrays, you must use the merge method from RecursionUtils.java.
o No loops are permitted to be written in this method nor in a helper method you create.
¬ß Hint: Write a helper method that takes in more parameters or use a provided
helper method.
o Example (each ‚Äú{name}‚Äù represents a Superhero object; the alliance is omitted):
¬ß Input: [["Iron Man", "Spider-Man"], ["Thor"],
["Captain America", "Hulk"]]
¬ß Output:["Captain America", "Hulk", "Iron Man",
"Spider-Man", "Thor"]
‚Ä¢ heroesOfAlliance
o Takes in a Superhero[] that is sorted in ascending lexicographical order by name,
and an Alliance representing the desired superhero alliance.
¬ß Assume the input array will not be null nor contain null elements.
o Returns a Superhero[] containing only the superheroes of the specified alliance.
o If the input array does not contain any superheroes on the specified alliance, return an
empty array.
o The returned array must be kept in ascending lexicographical order by name.
¬ß You may not call mergeSortHeroes nor use any sorting algorithms.
o No loops are permitted to be written in this method nor in a helper method you create.
¬ß Hint: Write a helper method that takes in more parameters or use provided
helper methods.
o Example (each ‚Äú<{name}, {alliance}>‚Äù represents a Superhero object):
¬ß Input: [<"Captain America, AVENGERS">,
<"Cyclops, XMEN">, <" Ben Grimm, FANTASTIC_FOUR">,
<"Iron Man, AVENGERS">, <" Wolverine, XMEN">],
"AVENGERS"
¬ß Output:[<"Captain America, AVENGERS">,
<"Iron Man, AVENGERS">]

‚Ä¢ totalStrength
o Takes in a Superhero[] and returns a double representing the total strength.
¬ß Assume the input array will not be null nor contain null elements.
o Remember that the strength of each hero depends on the alliance of the hero.
o No loops are permitted to be written in this method nor in a helper method you create.
o Example (each ‚Äú<{name}, {alliance}>‚Äù represents a Superhero object):
¬ß Input: [<"Captain America, AVENGERS">,
<"Cyclops, XMEN">, <"Ben Grimm, FANTASTIC_FOUR">,
<"Iron Man, AVENGERS">, <"Wolverine, XMEN">]
¬ß Output: 14.5
‚Ä¢ flip
o Takes in a Superhero[] that is sorted in ascending lexicographical order by name.
¬ß Assume the input array will not be null nor contain null elements.
o Returns nothing.
o The input array should be modified ‚Äúin-place‚Äù so that it becomes sorted in descending
lexicographical order by name.
¬ß Note: ‚ÄúIn place‚Äù means that the data in the original array should not ever be
copied to another data structure (e.g., another array).
o No loops are permitted to be used in this method nor in a helper method that is called
by this method.
¬ß Hint: Write a helper method that takes in more parameters.
o Example (each ‚Äú{name}‚Äù represents a Superhero object; the alliance is omitted):
¬ß Input: ["Captain America", "Hulk", "Iron Man",
"Spider-Man", "Thor"]
¬ß Output:["Thor", "Spider-Man", "Iron Man",
"Hulk", "Captain America"]

Checkstyle
You must run Checkstyle on your submission (to learn more about Checkstyle, check out cs1331-style-
guide.pdf under the Checkstyle Resources module on Canvas). The Checkstyle cap for this assignment is
40 points. This means there is a maximum point deduction of 40. If you don't have Checkstyle yet,
download it from Canvas √† Modules √† Checkstyle Resources √† checkstyle-8.28.jar. Place it in the
same folder as the files you want to run Checkstyle on. Run Checkstyle on your code like so:
$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar YourFileName.java
Starting audit...
Audit done.
The message above means there were no Checkstyle errors. If you had any errors, they would show up
above this message, and the number at the end would be the number of points we would take off
(limited by the Checkstyle cap). In future assignments we will be increasing this cap, so get into the habit
of fixing these style errors early!
Additionally, you must Javadoc your code.
Run the following to only check your Javadocs:
$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -j yourFileName.java
Run the following to check both Javadocs and Checkstyle:
$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -a yourFileName.java
For additional help with Checkstyle see the CS 1331 Style Guide.
Turn-In Procedure
Submission
To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on Gradescope:
‚Ä¢ ComicBookBin.java
Make sure you see the message stating the assignment was submitted successfully. From this point,
Gradescope will run a basic autograder on your submission as discussed in the next section. Any
autograder tests are provided as a courtesy to help ‚Äúsanity check‚Äù your work and you may not see all
the test cases used to grade your work. You are responsible for thoroughly testing your submission on
your own to ensure you have fulfilled the requirements of this assignment. If you have questions about
the requirements given, reach out to a TA or Professor via the class forum for clarification.
You can submit as many times as you want before the deadline, so feel free to resubmit as you make
substantial progress on the assignment. We will only grade your latest submission. Be sure to submit
every file each time you resubmit.

Gradescope Autograder
If an autograder is enabled for this assignment, you may be able to see the results of a few basic test
cases on your code. Typically, tests will correspond to a rubric item, and the score returned represents
the performance of your code on those rubric items only. If you fail a test, you can look at the output to
determine what went wrong and resubmit once you have fixed the issue. We reserve the right to hide
any or all test cases, so you should make sure to test your code thoroughly against the assignment's
requirements.
The Gradescope tests serve two main purposes:
‚Ä¢ Prevent upload mistakes (e.g., non-compiling code)
‚Ä¢ Provide basic formatting and usage validation
In other words, the test cases on Gradescope are by no means comprehensive. Be sure to thoroughly
test your code by considering edge cases and writing your own test files. You also should avoid using
Gradescope to compile, run, or Checkstyle your code; you can do that locally on your machine.
Other portions of your assignment can also be graded by a TA once the submission deadline has passed,
so the output on Gradescope may not necessarily reflect your grade for the assignment.
Burden of Testing
You are responsible for thoroughly testing your submission against the written requirements to ensure
you have fulfilled the requirements of this assignment.
Be very careful to note the way in which text output is formatted and spelled. Minor discrepancies could
result in failed autograder cases.
If you have questions about the requirements given, reach out to a TA or Professor via the class forum
for clarification.
Allowed Imports
To prevent trivialization of the assignment, you may not import any classes for this assignment.
Feature Restrictions
There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or
break our autograder. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:
‚Ä¢ var (the reserved keyword)
‚Ä¢ System.exit
‚Ä¢ System.arraycopy

Collaboration
Only discussion of the assignment at a conceptual high level is allowed. You can discuss course concepts
and assignments broadly; that is, at a conceptual level to increase your understanding. If you find
yourself dropping to a level where specific Java code is being discussed, that is going too far. Those
discussions should be reserved for the instructor and TAs. To be clear, you should never exchange code
related to an assignment with anyone other than the instructor and TAs.
The only code you may share are test cases written in a Driver class. If you choose to share your Driver
class, they should be posted to the assignment discussion thread on the course discussion forum. We
encourage you to write test cases and share them with your classmates, but we will not verify their
correctness (i.e., use them at your own risk).
You MAY NOT use code generation tools to complete this assignment. This includes generative AI tools
such as ChatGPT.
Important Notes (Don't Skip)
‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items.
‚Ä¢ Do not submit .class files.
‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope.
‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit.
‚Ä¢ Read the "Allowed Imports" and "Restricted Features" to avoid losing points.
‚Ä¢ Check on Ed Discussion for a note containing all official clarifications and sample outputs.
It is expected that everyone will follow the Student-Faculty Expectations document and the Student
Code of Conduct. The professor expects a positive, respectful, and engaged academic environment
inside the classroom, outside the classroom, in all electronic communications, on all file submissions,
and on any document submitted throughout the duration of the course. No inappropriate language is
to be used, and any assignment deemed by the professor to contain inappropriate offensive language
or threats will get a zero. You are to use professionalism in your work. Violations of this conduct policy
will be turned over to the Office of Student Integrity for misconduct.
